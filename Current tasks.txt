1 - Confirm current design with Babak -> make any necessary changes if asked
2 - Get Linux communication with the RFID scanner
3 - Swap out Kinect with Webcam at Lakeside
4 - Install Linux and necessary drivers/packages on the Lakeside PCs
5 - Switch the data collection to the new system 
6 - Figure out video file storage/transfer 
	* My idea is to have the computers running the cameras periodically send the data to a stronger PC on the same network (can use rsync) 
	* The data can be grabbed with a hard drive by the RA until the next steps
7 - Figure out how to run skeleton tracking at Lakeside to avoid the need to transfer large/confidential files 
8 - Figure out how to remotely transfer the data to UHN network 
9 - Data analysis (not sure if this step would be done by me or not)
