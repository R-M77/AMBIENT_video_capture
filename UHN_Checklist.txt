- Raspberry pi SDK (C/C++) - Scanner library used by RaspberryPi - INSTALLED/WORKING 
- Algorithm for handling edge cases - DONE -- Needs testing
   --> multi-detect, exit scenarios, anomalies, etc. 
- Code for communication b/w scanner and cameras to trigger ON/OFF - DONE  -- Have not been tested
- RaspberryPi <-> Scanner/Sensor communication - IN PROGRESS 
- Algorithms for transmitting data/captured frames to main processing PC - IN PROGRESS -- Most likely need to setup during on-site testing


Rremaining:
- Testing
- Cleaning up codebase and consolidation of Sam's work & mine (after testing)
- Documentations for setup and operations (SOP)
